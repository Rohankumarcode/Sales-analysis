Restaurant Data Analysis
Project Overview:
This project analyzes restaurant data to extract insights related to ratings, votes, cost, and popularity. Using Python libraries such as pandas, seaborn, matplotlib, and numpy, the analysis explores the relationships between different attributes of restaurants and presents key findings through visualizations.

Dataset
The dataset contains information about restaurants, including:
1.Restaurant names
2.Ratings
3.Votes
4.Approximate cost for two people
5.Availability of online ordering and table booking
6.Restaurant types and categories

Key Insights & Analysis:-
Restaurant Ratings Analysis
Identifies the highest and lowest-rated restaurants.
Displays the distribution of restaurant ratings.
Impact of Votes on Ratings
Analyzes how the number of votes affects ratings.
Checks for correlations between votes and ratings.
Relationship Between Cost and Ratings
Examines the correlation between cost and ratings.
Analyzes cost distribution across different restaurant categories.
Online Ordering and Cost Analysis
Compares the average cost of restaurants offering online ordering vs. those that donâ€™t.
Checks how many restaurants provide both online ordering and table booking.
Restaurant Popularity & Types
Identifies the most common restaurant types.
Determines the top 10 most popular restaurant categories.
Correlation and Trends
Identifies key trends in cost, ratings, and votes.
Explores how restaurant types vary in terms of cost.
